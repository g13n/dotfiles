## Note on fonts

Recently one of my friend recommended me a font that he is using for
programming and I believe it is one of the best fonts I have used apart from
Consolas.

Unlike Consolas, this font is open sourced by Adobe.
You can {http://blogs.adobe.com/typblography/2012/09/source-code-pro.html}(read
about Source Code Pro, and also download the font from this blog post) on Adobe.
