;;; Commentary:

;; I got tired of managing shells and one off Async Command buffers to
;; kick off Grunt tasks. This package provides rudimentary access to
;; the tasks in a Gruntfile.

;; When your default-directory is somewhere in a JS project with a
;; Gruntfile, invoke `grunt-exec' or bind something to it. You can
;; either execute one of the suggested registered tasks, or input a
;; custom task of your own. It will create one buffer per project per
;; task, killing any existing buffers by default.

;;; Code:

that we construct to do our task. Of course, if you rename your
buffer, we won't be able to kill it."
